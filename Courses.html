MOBLIE PROGAMMING</font></b>

<font size = "3" face = "Arial" >
<b>Course Description:</b></font> 
<font size = "2" face = "Arial" >
        Although they have only become widely used in the past few years, mobile devices have already had a tremendous impact on our culture 
        and its social dynamics. Recent rapid growth in the mobile device market has not been primarily driven by voice communications, but rather by the
        limitless ways in which these devices may be used to explore our local environments. These new communicative modes are expressed through 
        small and self-contained “apps” that are focused around a central concept, and that leverage many of the advanced features of these devices to
        augment a user’s understanding of her environment. This course operates in two distinct but related modes: development, wherein an app is made
        functional; and design, through which an app is made usable. Students will be expected to consider both modes when producing their apps. 
        Students will work throughout the semester to produce a compelling app of interest to the UNC community.

<font size = "3" face = "Arial" >
<b>Course Description:</b></font> 
<font size = "2" face = "Arial" >
        This course provides a comprehensive overview of website development. Students explore the prevailing vocabulary, tools, and standards 
        used in the field and learn how the various facets including HTML5, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, multimedia, scripting languages, 
        HTTP, clients, servers, and databases function together in today's web environment. The course provides a solid web development foundation, 
        focusing on content and client-side (browser) components (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, multimedia), with an overview of the server-side technologies 
        like Nodejs. In addition to user interaction, and personalization, data validation and processing of browser‐side data structures, data exchange 
        languages, and database access will be discussed. Software and services that are easily incorporated into a website (for example, maps, checkout, 
        blogs, content management) are surveyed and discussed. Students produce an interactive website on the topic of their choice for the final project 
        and leave the course prepared for more advanced and focused web development studies

COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND MULTIMEDIA</font></b>

<font size = "3" face = "Arial" >
<b>Course Description:</b></font> 
<font size = "2" face = "Arial" > 
    The area of multimedia includes a wide variety of data. In this module we will deal with pictures, animation, audio and 3D landscapes. 
    Images are built out of pixels. Each pixel has a certain color or grey tone. Handling images on this level will allow us to analyse and 
    manipulate images. On the practical side we will program effects in Java. For bringing images to life, e.g. for animation, we will use 
    the established Internet standard SVG. Images in SVG are described using XML documents. This allows scalability and animation. SVG 
    has similar features to FLASH. Completing the introduction to multimedia data we draw our attention to audio data. The understanding of 
    how to digitize sound and how to deal with sound in the digitalized format (e.g. writing sound effects) and its practical implementation 
    will be the focus here. In the last part of this module we will create virtual landscapes using Java 3D. Apart from the basic concepts 
    these landscapes contain different forms of lighting and lighting effects, moving objects and objects with different behaviors 
    (e.g collision behaviors). The main computer language for this module is Java including Java3D.
